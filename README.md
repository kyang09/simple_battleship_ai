# Simple Pirate Defense

This project is a simple battleship-like game.
The pirate sets 5 locations for ships, and an AI will try to attack the ships.

## Getting Started

This project was developed through an online code pen called: codepen.io
This website does a lot of set up, so the three files in this repo are designed to be pasted into the codepen.
Here's the codepen I used to develop this simple app: [https://codepen.io/kyang09/pen/KGrYKR](https://codepen.io/kyang09/pen/KGrYKR)
