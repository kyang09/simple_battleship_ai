# Simple Pirate Defense

This project is a simple battleship-like game.
The pirate sets 5 locations for ships, and an AI will try to attack the ships.

## Getting Started

This project was developed through an online code pen called: codepen.io
This website does a lot of set up, so the three files in this repo are designed to be pasted into the codepen.
Here's the codepen I used to develop this simple app: [https://codepen.io/kyang09/pen/KGrYKR](https://codepen.io/kyang09/pen/KGrYKR)

## Instructions

1. Before starting, place all 5 pirate ships on the board. Each pirate ship cell will be marked as "P".
2. Once all 5 ships have been placed, press the "START" button. The AI will try to attack the pirate ships.
3. Press the "Try Again" button to set all 5 pirate ships in another (or the same) formation.
4. Press "START" again.
5. Keep repeating steps 3 and 4 until you don't want to play anymore.
6. If you win or would like to reset the game and the AI, press the "RESET" button.
